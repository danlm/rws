    <h2>Shared object scripts</h2>

    <p>
      Shared object scripts are a possibly unique feature of <code>rws</code>.
      A shared object script is a CGI script, written in C, which
      is loaded into the address space of the server at runtime.
      Thus shared object scripts are very fast because they are
      written in C, loaded just once, and able to run without
      needing a <code>fork(2)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, the penalty for speed is security, although
      competent C programmers who are using all the features of
      <a href="http://www.annexia.org/freeware/c2lib/">c2lib</a> and
      <a href="http://www.annexia.org/freeware/pthrlib/">pthrlib</a>
      should be able to write code which is free of buffer overflows
      and some other common security issues. (However if you allow
      your server to run shared object scripts from untrusted
      third parties, then you have essentially no security at all, since
      shared object scripts can interfere with the internal workings
      of the webserver in arbitrary ways).
    </p>

    <h3>The anatomy of a shared object script</h3>

    <p>
      A shared object script is a <q><code>.so</code></q>
      file (in other words, a shared library or <q>DLL</q>).
      It should contain a single external symbol called
      <code>handle_request</code>, prototyped as:
    </p>

<pre>
int handle_request (rws_request rq);
</pre>

    <p>
      The <code>rws_request</code> object is defined in
      <code>rws_request.h</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first time that any client requests the shared
      object script, <code>rws</code> calls <code>dlopen(3)</code>
      on the file. As noted in the <code>dlopen(3)</code>
      manual page, this will cause <code>_init</code> and any
      constructor functions in the file to be run.
      Then <code>rws</code> creates the <code>rws_request</code>
      object (see below) and calls <code>handle_request</code>.
      The shared object script remains loaded in memory
      after <code>handle_request</code> has returned, ready
      for the next invocation.
    </p>

    <p>
      On subsequent invocations, <code>dlopen(3)</code> is
      <em>not</em> called, so constructors only run once.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, on each invocation, <code>rws</code> checks the
      modification time of the file on disk, and if it has
      changed, then it will attempt to reload the file. To
      do this, it calls <code>dlclose(3)</code> first, which
      will cause <code>_fini</code> and destructors in the
      library to run, and unloads the library from memory. It
      then reopens (<code>dlopen(3)</code>) the new file on
      disk, as above. Beware that there are some occasions when
      <code>rws</code> actually cannot reload a shared object
      script, even though it notices that the file has changed
      on disk. <code>rws</code> keeps a use count of the number
      of threads currently using the shared object script, and
      for safety reasons it cannot reload the file until this
      usage count drops to zero. This means that in some cases
      (eg. under very heavy load) a shared object script might
      never be reloaded, even if it changes on disk.
    </p>

    <h3>Configuring rws to recognise shared object scripts</h3>

    <p>
      <code>rws</code> will not try to run shared object scripts
      unless the <code>exec so</code> flag has been set on the
      alias, and the shared object script itself is executable (mode 0755).
      Here is an example shared object scripts directory:
    </p>

<pre>
alias /so-bin/
	path: /usr/share/rws/so-bin
	exec so: 1
end alias
</pre>

    <p>
      Make sure that the <code>so-bin</code> directory is only
      writable by trusted users, and make sure each shared object
      script is executable, mode 0755.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you can't make your shared object scripts run, then here
      is a checklist before you email me:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Make sure you have put the above alias section into
	the correct host file.
      <li> <code>exec so</code> option is set?
      <li> Restarted <code>rwsd</code>?
      <li> Directory is world readable, executable (mode 0755)?
      <li> Shared object script is world readable, executable (mode 0755)?
      <li> Any unresolved symbols (<code>ldd -r script.so</code>), apart
	from the <code>rws_request_*</code> symbols which will be resolved
	when the library is loaded into <code>rws</code>?
      <li> Missing <code>handle_request</code> function?
      <li> <code>handle_request</code> is exported in the dynamic
	symbol table (<code>nm -D script.so</code>)?
      <li> Check the contents of your error_log file to see
	if any error messages were reported.
    </ul>

    <p>
      I have quite successfully used <code>gdb</code> on a running
      server to debug and diagnose problems in shared object
      scripts. However note that by default <code>gdb</code> may
      have trouble loading the symbol table for your script. Use
      the <code>sharedlibrary script.so</code>
      command to load symbols instead.
    </p>

    <h3>Shared object scripts vs. Monolith applications</h3>

    <p>
      If you've been looking at the
      <a href="http://www.annexia.org/freeware/monolith/">Monolith
	application framework</a> pages, then you may be confused
      about how shared object scripts relate to Monolith.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shared object scripts are the direct analogy to CGI scripts,
      the only difference being that CGI scripts are usually written
      in very high level languages like Perl and PHP, and shared
      object scripts are loaded into the server process for efficiency.
      (Perl CGI scripts can also be loaded into the Apache
      server process using <code>mod_perl</code>, and this is done
      for similar reasons of efficiency).
    </p>

    <p>
      Monolith programs are entire applications, the sort of
      thing which normally would be written using dozens of
      cooperating CGI scripts. In the case of Monolith, however,
      the entire application compiles down to a single <code>.so</code>
      file which happens to be (you guessed it) a shared object script.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine that you are going to write yet another web-based email
      client. For some reason you want to write this in C (please
      don't try this at home: I wrote one in Perl at my last job and
      that was hard enough). Here are three possible approaches
      using C and <code>rws</code>:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Write forty or so shared object scripts. Each displays
	  a single frame of the application, one might generate
	  the frameset, a couple of dozen to implement specific
	  operations like emptying trash or moving a message between
	  folders.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This is very much the normal way of writing CGI-based
	  applications.
	</p>
      <li> Write a Monolith application. This will probably be
	in lots of C files, but will compile down and be linked
	into a single <code>.so</code> file (eg. <code>email.so</code>)
	which is dropped into the <code>so-bin</code> directory.
      <li>
	<p>
	  Write a Monolith email super-widget. This is going
	  to exist in a shared library called
	  <code>/usr/lib/libmyemail.so</code>
	  with a corresponding header file defining the interface
	  called <code>myemail.h</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Write a tiny Monolith application which just instantiates
	  a window and an email widget, and embeds the email widget
	  in the window. This will compile into <code>email.so</code>
	  (it'll be very tiny) which is dropped into <code>so-bin</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The advantage of this final approach is that you can
	  reuse the email widget in other places, or indeed sell
	  it to other Monolith users.
	</p>
    </ol>

    <p>
      So Monolith is good when you want to build applications
      from widgets as you would if you were building a
      Java/Swing, Windows MFC, gtk, Tcl/Tk graphical application.
      It's also good if code re-use is important to you.
      Shared object scripts are good when you are familiar with
      CGI-based techniques to build websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, the same <code>rws</code> server can serve
      shared object scripts, multiple Monolith applications,
      flat files, and directory listings, all at the same time.
    </p>

    <h3>Tutorial on writing shared object scripts</h3>

    <p>
      In this tutorial I will explain how the two shared object
      script examples supplied with <code>rws</code> work. You
      will also need to have read the tutorials for
      <a href="http://www.annexia.org/freeware/c2lib/">c2lib</a> and
      <a href="http://www.annexia.org/freeware/pthrlib/">pthrlib</a>
      which you can find by going to their respective web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first example, <code>hello.c</code> is very simple indeed.
      It's just a "hello world" program. The program starts by
      including <code>rws_request.h</code>:
    </p>

<pre>
#include &lt;rws_request.h&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      Following this is the <code>handle_request</code>
      function. This is the function which <code>rws</code>
      will call every time a user requests the script:
    </p>

<pre>
int
handle_request (rws_request rq)
{
  pseudothread pth = rws_request_pth (rq);
  http_request http_request = rws_request_http_request (rq);
  io_handle io = rws_request_io (rq);

  int close;
  http_response http_response;

  /* Begin response. */
  http_response = new_http_response (pth, http_request, io,
				     200, "OK");
  http_response_send_headers (http_response,
			      /* Content type. */
			      "Content-Type", "text/plain",
			      /* End of headers. */
			      NULL);
  close = http_response_end_headers (http_response);

  if (http_request_is_HEAD (http_request)) return close;

  io_fprintf (io, "hello, world!");

  return close;
}
</pre>

    <p>
      We first extract some fields from the <code>rws_request</code>
      object. <code>rws</code> has already taken the time to
      parse the HTTP headers from the client, but we need to
      generate the reply headers (shared object scripts
      are always "nph" -- no parsed headers). The
      <code>pthrlib</code> functions
      <code>new_http_response</code>,
      <code>http_response_send_headers</code> and
      <code>http_response_end_headers</code> do this. Note
      that we send a <code>Content-Type: text/plain</code>
      header. You must always generate a correct
      <code>Content-Type</code> header.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the original request was a <code>HEAD</code> request, then
      the client only wants to see the headers, so we stop here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Otherwise we generate our message and return.
    </p>

    <p>
      NB. Don't call <code>io_fclose</code> on the I/O handle! If you
      really want to force the connection to close, set the
      <code>close</code> variable to 1 and return it. This is
      because the client (or proxy) might be issuing several
      separate HTTP requests over the same kept-alive TCP connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second example, <code>show_params.c</code>, is just slightly
      more complex, but demonstrates how to do parameter parsing.
      After reading this you should have enough knowledge to
      go away and write your own shared object scripts that
      actually do useful stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      As before, we start by including a few useful headers:
    </p>

<pre>
#include &lt;pool.h&gt;
#include &lt;vector.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthr_cgi.h&gt;

#include &lt;rws_request.h&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      The <code>handle_request</code> function starts the same way
      as before:
    </p>

<pre>
int
handle_request (rws_request rq)
{
  pool pool = rws_request_pool (rq);
  pseudothread pth = rws_request_pth (rq);
  http_request http_request = rws_request_http_request (rq);
  io_handle io = rws_request_io (rq);
</pre>

    <p>
      Then we define some variables that we're going to use:
    </p>

<pre>
  cgi cgi;
  int close, i;
  http_response http_response;
  vector headers, params;
  struct http_header header;
  const char *name, *value;
</pre>

    <p>
      The actual job of parsing out the CGI parameters is simplified
      because <code>pthrlib</code> contains a CGI library
      (similar to Perl's <code>CGI.pm</code>):
    </p>

<pre>
  /* Parse CGI parameters. */
  cgi = new_cgi (pool, http_request, io);
</pre>

    <p>
      The response phase begins by sending the HTTP
      headers as before:
    </p>

<pre>
  /* Begin response. */
  http_response = new_http_response (pth, http_request, io,
				     200, "OK");
  http_response_send_headers (http_response,
			      /* Content type. */
			      "Content-Type", "text/plain",
			      /* End of headers. */
			      NULL);
  close = http_response_end_headers (http_response);

  if (http_request_is_HEAD (http_request)) return close;
</pre>

    <p>
      Now we print out the actual contents of both the
      <code>http_request</code> object and the <code>cgi</code>
      object. HTTP headers first:
    </p>

<pre>
  io_fprintf (io, "This is the show_params shared object script.\r\n\r\n");
  io_fprintf (io, "Your browser sent the following headers:\r\n\r\n");

  headers = http_request_get_headers (http_request);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; vector_size (headers); ++i)
    {
      vector_get (headers, i, header);
      io_fprintf (io, "\t%s: %s\r\n", header.key, header.value);
    }

  io_fprintf (io, "----- end of headers -----\r\n");
</pre>

    <p>
      The full URL (including the query string), the path alone,
      the query string:
    </p>

<pre>
  io_fprintf (io, "The URL was: %s\r\n",
	      http_request_get_url (http_request));
  io_fprintf (io, "The path component was: %s\r\n",
	      http_request_path (http_request));
  io_fprintf (io, "The query string was: %s\r\n",
	      http_request_query_string (http_request));
  io_fprintf (io, "The query arguments were:\r\n");
</pre>

    <p>
      Finally we print out the CGI parameters from the <code>cgi</code>
      object:
    </p>

<pre>
  params = cgi_params (cgi);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; vector_size (params); ++i)
    {
      vector_get (params, i, name);
      value = cgi_param (cgi, name);
      io_fprintf (io, "\t%s=%s\r\n", name, value);
    }

  io_fprintf (io, "----- end of parameters -----\r\n");

  return close;
}
</pre>
